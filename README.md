# CrashCourse

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.12.
The app was built as a code along with the [Angular Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8) by [Traversy Media](https://traversymedia.com).

## Description

An app that lets users CRUD tasks. Backend is a static file that's being served by using [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

## Purpose

To freshen up my Angular skills, I took this 2 hour project based course. It covers the basics and an introduction to [RxJS](https://www.learnrxjs.io/) by using Observables and Subjects.
Also routing was used, altough only to the homepage.

## Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the Angular CLI version 11.2.12 installed to run this project. See below.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## JSON server

Run `npm run server` to run backend json-server on `http://localhost:5000`.
